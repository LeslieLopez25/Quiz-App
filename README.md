<h1>Quiz App</h1>

<h2>A quiz game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</h2>

<p>This project is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this following the tutorial of Brian Design. I've changed the changed the original four questions, added six additional questions to the game, added a reset button to clear the top five scores,  color scheme, and values of measure. This project was fun to build and a great experience. Lots of JavaScript was used to for the high scores and questions that I've never used before and it helped me to get a better understanding of JavaScript and how to use it to build something like a quiz game.</p>
